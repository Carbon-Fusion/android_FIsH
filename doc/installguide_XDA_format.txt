[SIZE="5"]Requirements[/SIZE]

Here are the pre-requirements you have to met!
If you can't get them: [B][U]Close this page and FORGET it (until the day you met those reqs)![/U][/B]

Here are the 2 simple requirements you have to met:

[LIST]
[*][B]1. root by SuperSU >=v2.76[/B] (greater or equal v2.76)
--> to test this requirement just start the installer of FIsH with --check (see next lines) which will check for all requirements and abort if its not possible
--> for many devices - if not all - this means you HAVE TO downgrade/install LL. It also means that you have to upgrade your SuperSU to this version by e.g. FlashFire if you have a lower version installed!
--> SU by phh is NOT supported => It needs a modified /boot and this would void the boot signing chain!
--> Magisk is NOT supported => It needs a modified /boot and this would void the boot signing chain!
--> I will NOT provide downgrading guides there are plenty of them so search and read.
--> I will NOT provide any guides in rooting your device
--> Before you think about downgrading to LL read about ANTI-ROLLBACK protection some devices and may have! Anti-Rollback means you CAN NOT downgrade - it would HARD-BRICK your device (wtf thinking the vendors who we are?? Is this even legal?!)! Check that before!!
[*][B]2. you have to be able to disable SELinux[/B] in your booted Android
--> You do NOT need to set SELinux [B]permanently[/B] to permissive. Just [B][U]CHECK[/U][/B] if you [B][U]COULD[/U][/B] get it [B][U]MANUALLY[/U][/B]. If you can get it OK. If not.. you obviously have not full root access but check the forums maybe there is something you can do about this.
--> I will NOT provide any guides enabling SELinux but some lines later you will see how u can execute the very simple check
--> to test this requirement just start the installer of FIsH with --check (see next lines) which will check for all requirements and abort if its not possible
[/LIST]

Those above are hard facts so it may NEVER work with MM. Google has changed the way on how the boot chain will be verified and that means changes in /system will void it from now on.
If MM can get fully rooted somehow/somewhen on your device with SuperSU installed and you are able to disable SELinux the method will work there as well.

If you can not meet ALL of the above 2 requirements lay down and cry. 
For the others: calm down and read on!

[B]You can simply test those both requirements by downloading the FIsH package and execute the installer with the following test parameter:

[SIZE="4"][/B][COLOR="blue"][B]./install.sh --check[/B][/COLOR][/SIZE]

This way nothing get installed but you will see if it would work on your device or not.

[SIZE="5"][COLOR="Red"]Limitations![/COLOR][/SIZE]

Keep in mind what I said above: FIsH does NOT unlock your bootloader!
That means with TWRP-in-FIsH you can [B][U]NOT[/U][/B]:
[LIST]
[*]Install a custom ROM like CM/Lineage (this will modify boot = SOFT-BRICK)
[*]Install a custom Kernel (this will modify boot = SOFT-BRICK)
[*]Install a custom recovery (this will modify recovery = may SOFT-BRICK)
[*]In short: do nothing which modifies boot or recovery partitions. Those changes will BREAK your boot signing chain.
[*]You can of course flash everything which is modifying /system /data only (e.g. xposed, Audio mods, etc...)
[*]You're able to backup and restore as well of course and doing any other modifications which you may can't while the Android system is running.
[/LIST]


[U][SIZE="4"]Download[/SIZE][/U]

READ THE [COLOR="red"][B][U]REQUIREMENTS[/U][/B][/COLOR] above before proceeding!

... and [B][U]NEVER[/U][/B] ask for ETA's! ;)

if you can say: 
[B][I]Yes! I have read and [U]totally[/U] understood the [U]limitations[/U] AND the [U]requirements[/U]![/I][/B] 
then proceed. Otherwise read again until you got it.
[HIDE]Keep in mind that this is a HACK. It may soft-brick your device. you have been warned! 
The concept is the same for all models but again no guarantees here for anything. 
There is [B][U]ALWAYS[/U][/B] a risk and you should better [B][U]backup[/U][/B] what you do not want to loose before starting downloading this.

Go to the [B][U]DOWNLOADS[/U][/B] tab in this thread.

[U][SIZE="4"]Installation (Linux)[/U][/SIZE]

You can just install any newer version over an old one.

[LIST=1]
[*]boot Android and connect USB cable
[*]download the newest version to your PC and open a terminal in that directory
[*]tar xzf TWRP-in-FIsH*.tgz
[*]cd android_FIsH
[*]./install.sh
[*]check the output of that script. you should not see any errors there (hopefully)
[/LIST]

[U][SIZE="4"]Installation (Windows)[/SIZE]
[/U]
use [URL="http://tinyurl.com/FWULatXDA"]FWUL[/URL] or be patient.. maybe i or someone else release an installer... maybe...


[U][SIZE="4"]First run (no PC required)[/U][/SIZE]

This FIsH gets installed [B]PERMANENTLY[/B]! That means:
You can boot up TWRP the same way as described here again without re-installing.
If you re-install your STOCK image you have to re-install TWRPinFIsH as well.

[LIST=1]
[*]reboot Android
[*]you should now see: LED goes from blue to [U][B][COLOR="green"][U]GREEN[/U][/COLOR][/B][/U]
[*]NOW [B]directly[/B] when u see this [COLOR="green"][B][U]GREEN[/U][/B][/COLOR] LED press [B]VOLUME DOWN [/B]and [B]do NOT release[/B]
[*]wait [B]until the device vibrates[/B] and the LED changed to [COLOR="red"][B][U]RED[/U][/B][/COLOR]. Then release the Volume Down button.
[*]Wait until FIsH completed and TWRP should be shown --> This means FIsH has done it's job well!
[*]This is a good time to do a full backup isn't it ? ;) Manually mount the SYSTEM partition as it gets not auto mounted atm and do a full backup
[*]reboot from here (safely ignore the msg "no OS installed" and reboot anyways) and you should see Android booting (hopefully ... if not see bottom)
[/LIST]

[U][SIZE="4"]Daily Usage (no PC required)[/U][/SIZE]

[*]Wait until FIsH completed and TWRP should be shown --> This means FIsH is doing it's job still very well :)
[*][COLOR="red"][B][U]AGAIN[/U][/B]: keep your mind up! You HAVE to ensure that whatever you do and whatever you flash -> [B][U]NEVER TOUCH BOOT/RECOVERY[/U][/B]! If you flash a ZIP ensure first that it do not modify them! Otherwise you WILL [U][B]softbrick[/B][/U]. You have been warned (several times now)[/COLOR]
[/LIST]

[U][SIZE="4"]Trouble / Bootloop fix[/SIZE]
[/U]if you encounter a bootloop (should never happen but who knows) you have 3 choices at least: 
[LIST=1]
[*]Option 1a: (TWRP-Bootloop) Within TWRP open Advanced -> File Manager -> Goto: /system/su.d and click "select" button -> Delete
Option 1b: (TWRP-Bootloop) From your PC: [COLOR="Blue"]adb shell rm -rf /system/su.d/[/COLOR] 
[B][U]Important[/U][/B]: Catch the fish log (see next topic)
[*]Option 2 (this works also for a bootloop without twrp): boot into download mode and use [URL="https://github.com/Lekensteyn/lglaf"]LGLaf[/URL] to get a shell
then:
[COLOR="Blue"]setenforce 0[/COLOR] <-- if that doesn't work you may have to do a FULL restore to stock
[COLOR="blue"]mount -oremount,rw /system
rm -rf /system/su.d/[/COLOR]
reboot. You are out of the bootloop.
[B][U]Important[/U][/B]: Catch the fish log (see next topic)
[*]Option 3: Last resort: Reflash STOCK. sorry.. there is always a risk..
[/LIST]

[U]Catch the FIsH logs[/U][LIST]
[*]when in TWRP (or other ramdisk providing adb shell):
[COLOR="Blue"]adb shell "cat /cache/fish/fish.log"[/COLOR]
[COLOR="Blue"]adb shell "cat /tmp/recovery.log"[/COLOR]
[*]OR - when in Android:
[COLOR="Blue"]adb shell "su -c cat /cache/fish/fish.log"[/COLOR]
[COLOR="Blue"]adb shell "su -c cat /cache/fish/fish.log.old"[/COLOR]
[COLOR="Blue"]adb shell "su -c tar cvzf recoverylogs.tgz /cache/recovery"[/COLOR]
[COLOR="Blue"]adb pull recoverylogs.tgz[/COLOR]
[*]Upload the output to [url]https://paste.omnirom.org[/url] and paste the link in the IRC channel (see next topic)

[COLOR="red"][SIZE="4"][B][U]Known issues (may never get fixed)[/U][/B][/SIZE]
[/COLOR]
Due to the fact that FIsH is a BRUTAL hijack of the booting process several things may not work as expected.
This will normally not harm anything but you have to know about.

[U]ZIP / ROM flashing:[/U]
omg really you wanna hear that again? OK: DON'T TOUCH BOOT / RECOVERY. And you be safe.
When you try to install a ROM it will modify at least  BOOT. That means soft-brick!
When you try to install a custom Kernel.. omg really? It will definitively SOFT-BRICK! Maybe you should read the limitations again?? :p
When you try to install a ZIP like xposed, supersu, Vipermod and others ensure that those are not modifying BOOT or RECOVERY partitions. For those mentioned it would be very unlikely but who knows.

[U]XXXXXX partition:[/U]
cannot be mounted - even not manually. You have to live with it.
